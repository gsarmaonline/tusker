# Tusker

One single place for all your integrations and backend tasks.

Tired of thinking whether to setup an AWS EC2 VM or setup a PaaS worker to perform a task?
Tired of setting up the same thing again and again? Like email provider, SMS provider, setting
up Google Oauth?

Let's fix it once and for all.

Tusker is the one stop setup machine(s) where you can setup all your workflows so that every
task is just an API away.

Need a cron job? Fire an API.
Need to send an email? Fire an API.

You don't have to do all the API integration and the token management anymore.

Worried about data leaks across different apps? Don't be. Tusker allows you to categorise
your secrets based on apps as well. It also allows you to share the same secret but operate
on entire different constraints/templates based on the app.

Bottom line: Once you integrate with an external API, you never have to do it again.

Tusker will also monitor your API usage and send you regular updates on how the apps are using
the APIs. You can setup alerts for that.
